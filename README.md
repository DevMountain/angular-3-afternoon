# Project Summary

In this project, we'll make use of Angular components and routing to complete a website that sells swag. The file structure has already been setup for you and should feel very familiar to the mini project. There are also two services that have been built out for you. One is the swag service, it holds all the data for swag that is available for purchase. The other service holds all the cart functionality. Take a minute to understand how the cart works before beginning the project.

In addition to the services, the Angular application has routing pre-built for you as well. This should be very similiar to the routing you've already practiced earlier in the course. The only difference here is in the router's configuration. When dealing with components you can actually provide the component's name in the router's configuration and it will automagically know which HTML to render.

It is imperative to feel comfortable with the existing code base before attempting this project. If you are having trouble, feel free to ask a fellow classmate or one of your mentors.
